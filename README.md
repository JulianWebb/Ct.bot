# Ct.bot

Documentation lookup bot for Ct.js Discord

## Running

You'll need to have a `config.json` file. This contains things such as the
firebase config, token, prefix, and more.

First run `npm i` to install dependencies.

Then run `npm run start` to start the bot.

If you're developing it run `npm run dev`. This will restart the bot when
javascript files are changed.

-   [ ] Alerts when documentation has been updated
-   [x] Allow users to add questions with answers to help other people out
    -   [ ] Approval process using administrator array or special channel
